I bought this coffee maker a few months ago, and it’s been nothing but trouble. The machine constantly leaks water all over the counter, and no matter how many times I try to fix it, the problem keeps coming back. I’ve called customer support multiple times, but they haven’t been able to resolve the issue. I’m so disappointed because I really wanted to like this product, but I can't deal with cleaning up the mess every morning. I wud not recommend this coffee maker to anyone.
